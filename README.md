### TextEmotes
Adds discord style emote commands.

#### What is this?
This adds 3 commands for easy emotes.

#### What does this do?
It adds the commands, /tableflip, /unflip, and /shrug.

#### Why did I make this?
It is a crime that Minecraft doesn't support /shrug. Plus, I wanted to maximize table flippage.

#### This doesn't work!
